              Why American Sign Language?

              For millennia, deaf people were neither considered humans nor were they treated with respect. Nobody even tried to communicate with them.
              But this injustice against them started coming to an end in the Renaissance, when people understood that deaf people were also capable of language. <b>The 
                person who played a big role in this transformation is <span style="color: red">Charles-Michel de l'Épée</span>, a French priest and philanthropist, who is now hailed as the Father of the deaf.</b>
              In the 1700s, Charles-Michel de l'Épée had a chance encounter with two young deaf sisters who were communicating with sign language. 
              This inspired him to dedicate his life for the deaf. Soon, he developed a system of instruction of the French language and religion using the sign language and 
              founded the world's first free school for the deaf <i>(shown in the left)</i>.
              Decades later, De lÉpée's methods inspired Laurent Clerc, a deaf teacher from France. In 1815, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, an American searching for a way to teach
              the deaf, met Clerc. Gallaudet invited Clerc to come to the USA. Once they arrived there, Clerc taught Gallaudet how to use the sign language, and in return, 
              Gallaudet taught Clerc English. Together, they established the first school for the deaf in the USA in Connecticut, where it stands even today (Source: <a href ="https://www.hearinglikeme.com/sign-languages-around-the-world/#:~:text=American%20Sign%20Language%20(ASL)%20is,Thomas%20Gallaudet%20and%20Laurent%20Clerc." target="_blank">www.hearinglikeme.com</a>). This is how ASL
              came into existence. Today, ASL is the widely used sign language across the world, with signers in the USA, Canada, Mexico, Africa, and Asia (Source: <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/American-Sign-Language-Workbook-Vocabulary/dp/1646119509" target="_blank">American Sign Language Workbook</a>). That's why I chose 
              ASL - To help as much as many people as possible.
