    <h1> WüåçRLD HISTORY MAPS</h1>

    <h3>Welcome to Atlas of World History</h3>
    <p>History teaches us valuable lessons, and its philosophy shows us what mistakes we should avoid and engages people to look into their cultural heritage. A great way to visualize history is by studying history maps, graphic representations of past events. </p>
    <p>The project started by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Talessman">Thomas Lessman</a> , an amateur historian with over 20 years of experience in researching history, aims to show the readers how the rest of the world looked like in different time periods and ease searching for a complete world history map.</p>

    <p>World History Maps are used in dozens of Wikipedia history articles, and several historical sites link to them or use them directly, with our permission.</p>
    <p>Each map is designed after thorough research, and it is based on the information available to us. This information is listed in the <span style="color:red ; font-size:25; font-style: italic;">Sources</span>  section of the website <a href="https://www.worldhistorymaps.info/">(worldhistorymaps.info)</a>.
         Also, these history maps are updated as often as possible when new information becomes available to us. You can find out everything related to the latest additions by visiting the <span style="color:red ; font-size:25; font-style: italic ;">Updates</span>  page.</p>
    <p>The World History Maps site includes information about many world history events and World History Maps that show the borders of kingdoms and locations of tribes, from prehistoric times to the present, approximately every 50 to 100 years.</p>

    <h3>What do history maps show?</h3>
    <p>History maps have different purposes. You can learn about the distribution of ancient tribes and populations, social movements or trade routes, and how the boundaries shifted over a certain period. Thanks to historical maps, the location of ancient kingdoms is no longer a mystery. Historical resources maps give us some hints on what resources one region possessed and how that particular area evolved.</p>
    <p>The World History Maps website includes information about hundreds of world history events and World History Maps that show the borders of civilizations and locations of tribes, from prehistoric times to the present, approximately every 50 to 100 years.</p>
    <p>We will list below the most important types of world history maps that you may want to search and use.</p>

    <ol>1. Political history maps</ol>
    <p>These types of world history maps usually depict states and the boundaries of these kingdoms or empires. A more recent map will show you, for example, how major events like World Wars changed Europe‚Äôs region map and, ultimately, its philosophy.</p>
    <ol>2. Physical history maps</ol>
    <p>Another important thing you can find out by studying a history map is how a certain civilization altered a particular landscape. For example, comparing an old map of a region with a more recent one, you will see how green portions of the map area have been replaced by the darker shades used to depict buildings or roads.</p>
    <ol>3. Military history maps</ol>
    <p>History maps depicting battles or wars will show the territories occupied by each army and the troops‚Äô movements. For example, the world history maps of a larger breadth depicting World Wars will show each side in a different color. Each military world history map will also mark the locations of the most important battles.</p>
    <ol>4. Road history maps</ol>
    <p>Similar to nowadays, older civilizations used road maps for their migrations or economic trade routes between different regions. These world history maps allow us to look in the past and make an idea about how a road trip looked like for our ancestors.</p>
