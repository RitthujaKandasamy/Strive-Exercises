    <h3>Welcome to Atlas of World History</h3>
    <p>History teaches us valuable lessons, and its philosophy shows us what mistakes we should avoid and engages people to look into their cultural heritage. A great way to visualize history is by studying history maps, graphic representations of past events. </p>
    <p>The project started by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Talessman">Thomas Lessman</a> , an amateur historian with over 20 years of experience in researching history, aims to show the readers how the rest of the world looked like in different time periods and ease searching for a complete world history map.</p>
    <p>It is a great experience for world history enthusiasts to find map resources in one place, even for those still studying in school. If you are interested in a particular region, kingdom, 
       or what was the name of a certain location thousands of years ago, you can find it all here, by browsing through our history maps!</p>

    <p>World History Maps are used in dozens of Wikipedia history articles, and several historical sites link to them or use them directly, with our permission.</p>
    <p>Each map is designed after thorough research, and it is based on the information available to us. This information is listed in the <span style="color:red ; font-size:25; font-style: italic;">Sources</span>  section of the website <a href="https://www.worldhistorymaps.info/">(worldhistorymaps.info)</a>.
         Also, these history maps are updated as often as possible when new information becomes available to us. You can find out everything related to the latest additions by visiting the <span style="color:red ; font-size:25; font-style: italic ;">Updates</span>  page.</p>
