# Google-Fit

## Week Plan:    
*Monday*: Understanding the data, how it has been collected and preprocessed. Create Metadata about sensorsâ€™ outputs.  

*Tuesday*: EDA  and Preprocessing. Selection of final model.  

*Wednesday*:   
* Before noon: Tuning the model (hyperparamater tuning, data enhancement).  
* Afternoon: Design the App(what features to add, how it should look like) + first version of the App (we use streamlit)  

*Thursday*: Finish the App and prepare final presentation.  

*Friday*:  
* Morning: (Last fixes in case any)  
* Afternoon: (Last rehearsal for presentation)  



## Today's Plan (Tuesday)  
*EDA* (Ritthu)  
Using Graphext explore the followings:  

* Missing values (how many in each column in %)  
* Distribution of features (histogram + kde)   
* Is target balanced?  
* Correlations between features and relation between features and target  
* Prepare final plots for presentation  


*PREPROCESSING* (Theo)  
* Cleaning data (any column/row to drop)  
* Missing value imputation  
* Create functions and pipelines to easily run experimentations  
* Try out first chosen models  




## Wednesday's Plan:
*MODEL* (Theo)

* Final model selection [after kickoff to 11:00]
* See if any performance increase with data enhancement [11:00 to 13:00]
* Break [13:00 - 13:30]
* Hyperparamater tuning [13:30 - 14:30]
* Work on second version of the model that can works on most of the devices (fewer and common sensor data) without losing too much accuracy [14:30 - 16:30]
* Start working on second page of the App [16:30 - 18:00]

*STREAMLIT* (Ritthu)
   
* Plan what features to add in it.[after kickoff to 11:00]
* Plan how it should look like.[11:30 to 13:00]
* Create first page of the streamlit.[13:00 to 16:00]
* Finalize[17:00 to 18:00]

*PRESENTATION* (Andrea)
* Create the presentation with PowerPoint[from 13.00 to 16:00]


## Thursday's Plan:
*Theo*
* Last attempt to increase accuracy for all activities classification [after kickoff-12:00]
* If it doesn't work, switch to a simplified version of modeling the target [12:00 - 13:00]
* Break [13:00 - 13:30]
* Hyperparameter tuning [13:30 - 14:30]
* Integrate the model to the App [14:30 - 16:30]
* Any additional feature Ritthuja will want me to work on [16:30 - 18:00]

*Andrea*
* Team recap [after kickoff-10:45]
* Try to use data enhancement to increase accuracy [11.00-13:30]
* Lunch break [13.30-14:00]
* Focus on the streamlit app [14.00-16:00]

*Ritthu*
* Streamlit app [11:00-16:00]
